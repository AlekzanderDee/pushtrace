## Pushtrace

This is a frontend part of the tracing project. The project is not maintained at the moment 
so it should be considered more as an experiment or as a set of 
examples of React - Redux - Resux-Saga - Styled-Components usage.

The code base by itself is not consistent as many approaches of code grouping, 
building CSS were tried during the development process.
